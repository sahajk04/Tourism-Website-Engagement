# Tourism Website Engagement Analysis üìä‚úàÔ∏è

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer engagement data from an online tourism website to provide actionable insights for improving targeted marketing strategies. The goal is to transition from a broad marketing outreach to a more data-driven approach by leveraging customer behavior across different devices. This project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualizations to help the company optimize ad spend and enhance customer engagement.

## Key Objectives

- **Segment customer behavior** based on the device used (laptop vs. mobile) for better-targeted ads.
- Analyze key engagement metrics like views, likes, comments, and travel preferences.
- Provide **data-driven marketing recommendations** for personalized ad delivery.
- Identify high-value customers based on behavior patterns such as time spent on the platform, check-ins, and social interactions.

## Data

The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:
- `UserID`: Unique identifier for each user.
- `Taken_product`: The travel product selected by the user.
- `Yearly_avg_view_on_travel_page`: Average number of yearly views on travel pages.
- `Preferred_device`: The device used to access the travel platform (Laptop or Mobile).
- `Total_likes_on_outstation_checkin_given`: Total likes given by the user on outstation check-ins.
- `Preferred_location_type`: The type of location preferred (beach, mountain, etc.).
- And other columns related to user activity on the platform.

## Analysis & Insights

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Investigated booking trends, user engagement, and correlations between various user activity metrics (e.g., time spent on site, device used).
   - Visualized top locations, customer segmentation, and seasonal behavior patterns.
   
2. **Behavioral Segmentation**: 
   - Created separate models for laptop and mobile users to address distinct engagement behaviors.
   - Identified key customer segments based on their interaction patterns (e.g., frequent travelers, business travelers, etc.).

3. **Marketing Recommendations**:
   - Suggested targeted advertising strategies focusing on specific user groups and product preferences.
   - Optimized digital ad spending by focusing on users more likely to convert based on historical data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**:
  - `pandas` for data cleaning and manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
  

## Results

The analysis helped in:
- Optimizing the marketing strategy by focusing on high-value customer segments.
- Differentiating between engagement behaviors on laptops and mobile devices to deliver personalized ads.
- Providing data-driven insights to reduce ad spending waste by targeting users with high conversion probabilities.

## Future Work

- Incorporate more granular feedback data to improve customer satisfaction analysis.
- Explore more user behavior patterns based on additional travel product preferences.
